Do you like brownie crust? Or do you prefer the amazing, gooey, chocolatey "guts" of the brownie? There's only one right answer. But in case you're a crazy person, this guide will also help you to determine the optimal shape for your brownie pan.

We'll define the crust-to-brownie ratio as follows:

$$CTB = \frac{\text{perimeter(pan)}}{\text{area(pan)}}$$

We are trying to minimize this number.

## Square pan

If you're using a square pan with side length \\\(L\\\), that means the total area of brownie you can make is \\\(L^2\\\). The crust, or perimeter would be \\\(4L\\\).

Therefore, the crust-to-brownie ratio is...

$$CTB = \frac{4L}{L^2} = \frac{4}{L}$$

To standardize on our measurements \\\(L=1\\\). That means that \\\(CTB=4\\\), or there is 4 units-of-crust-per-unit-of-brownie.

## Rectangular pan

If you have a rectangular pan with side lengths \\\(L_1\\\) and \\\(L_2\\\), the total area of brownie you can make is \\\(L_1L_2\\\) and the crust would be \\\(2(L_1+L_2)\\\). We can again figure out the crust-to-brownie ratio.

$$CTB = \frac{2(L_1+L_2)}{L_1L_2}$$

Let's say that \\\(L_1=L\\\) and \\\(L_2 = aL\\\) where \\\(a\\\) is the aspect ratio of our pan. Now we can simplify \\\(CTB\\\).

$$CTB = \frac{2(L+aL)}{L \cdot aL} = \frac{2(1+a)L}{aL^2} = \frac{2(1+a)}{aL}$$

Again with our standard side length, \\\(CTB = \frac{2(1+a)}{a}\\\). Here are some common pan aspect ratios:

- For a 4:3 brownie pan (\\\(a=\frac{3}{4}\\\)) then \\\(CTB \approx 4.667\\\)
- For a 3:2 brownie pan (\\\(a=\frac{2}{3}\\\)) then \\\(CTB = 5\\\)
- For a 2:1 brownie pan (\\\(a=\frac{1}{2}\\\)) then \\\(CTB = 6\\\)

That means the longer our brownie pan, the more crust we get per brownie.

## Pie Tin

What if we bake our brownies in the shape of a circle? Blasphemy! Delicious blasphemy. We would bake \\\(\pi L\\\) crust and make \\\(\frac{\pi}{4}L^2\\\) brownie.

$$CTB = \frac{\pi L}{\frac{\pi}{4}L^2} = \frac{4}{L}$$

WIP.
