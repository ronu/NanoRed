description: So you want to publish an article?
---
First of all, that's great news and we'd love to have you as an our newest guest [author](/authors)!
Let's go over some of the requirements and guidelines to write a professional, effective article.

## Requirements

What's required, besides the article? We need some *metadata* that goes with it. The metadata helps customize how it's displayed in the front page and article's page. These metadata fields are required.

- `title` The title of the article
- `description` One sentence describing the contents of the article

The following fields are optional, but recommended to even further personalize your article.

- `author` Your name, how you'd like to appear on NanoRed
    - If not provided, the author will be *Anonymous*
- `date` This will be set to the date the article is published or has major edits
    - The articles with the most recent dates are shown on the front page
- `tags` You can categorize your article with existing [tags](/tag) or create your own
- `thumbnail` The image URL address to use as your article's thumbnail
    - This is shown on the front page and at the top of the article's page
    - Unfortunately, we cannot accept raw image files, so they will need to be uploaded to a service like [postimage](https://postimages.org/) or [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/) to generate a URL for the image

## Contributing Guidelines

You might be thinking, *what can I write about?* The answer is pretty much anything! NanoRed is an inclusive space that respects all opinions and points of view. Additionally, many topics are allowed and encouraged to be explored here. There are a few rules listed below to keep the peace that NanoRed is striving to cultivate.
