description: So you want to publish an article?
---
First of all, that's great news and we'd love to have you as an our newest guest [author](/authors)!
Let's go over some of the requirements and guidelines to write a professional, effective article.

## Requirements

What's required, besides the article? We need some *metadata* that goes with it. The metadata helps customize how it's displayed in the front page and article's page. These metadata fields are required.

- `title` The title of the article
- `description` One sentence describing the contents of the article

The following fields are optional, but recommended to even further personalize your article.

- `author` Your name, how you'd like to appear on NanoRed
    - If not provided, the author will be *Anonymous*
- `date` This will be set to the date the article is published or has major edits
    - The articles with the most recent dates are shown on the front page
- `tags` You can categorize your article with existing [tags](/tag) or create your own
- `thumbnail` The image URL address to use as your article's thumbnail
    - This is shown on the front page and at the top of the article's page
    - Unfortunately, we cannot accept raw image files, so they will need to be uploaded to a service like [postimage](https://postimages.org/) or [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/) to generate a URL for the image
